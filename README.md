# IbnoxFrontEnd
The Front End code of a Content Sharing Website, Ibnox.com, which is no longer online.

This project was to revamp the Front End of the website. I was the sole Front End Developer on this project, with my senior Mr. Rachit Goyal creating the design layouts. It was more than halfway through when it was cancelled as the company changed its business model and course of action.

The Founder of Ibnox, Mr. Neel Shah, was kind enough to allow me to put this code up on my personal repository.

All credits of the designing go to Mr. Rachit Goyal. I wrote the entire code for this project based off the PSD designs he created.
